/* shared/specialties.js — the SHARED specialty (class) CATALOG DATA, consumed by both the frontend
   (frontend/app/specialties.js — the Recruitment Bay + summon) and the sidecar (team.summon class
   listing + summon defaults). ONE source of truth so a lead-summoned specialist gets the identical
   loadout the bay would give it.

   This module owns ONLY the raw, frozen catalog data + the tier vocabulary. The frontend module wraps
   it (freezeSpec / ranking-tags / the save-your-own custom store / compose) — this file stays DOM-free
   and node-loadable so both sides + the tests can read it without a browser.

   TWO SHELVES (catalog expansion, 2026-08-03 — supersedes the 2026-07-16 business-grade redesign):
     BUILTINS   — the CURATED roster the bay lists by default: 22 classes spanning every lane the Commander
                  actually lives in, not business alone. The 2026-07-16 bar ("useful in any business") had
                  narrowed the visible roster to 12 job titles and left the rest folded into a collapsed
                  archive, which read as bare. The bar is now: does this class own an OUTCOME nobody else on
                  the roster owns? Three groups sit alongside the original business dozen —
                    • CAPABILITY classes built on what only this harness can do: pilot (drives a real
                      browser), foreman (splits work across the crew), nightwatch (the unattended shift);
                    • LIFE & MONEY classes for the jobs outside work: paralegal, negotiator, jobhunter,
                      ghostwriter;
                    • PROMOTED deep cuts whose demand was never niche: chief, envoy, tutor.
                  The FIRST entry is the bay's default card.
     ARCHETYPES — the deep-cut pool: fully-specified classes that most users never need on day one
                  (niche, generalist, or lifestyle jobs). NOT listed on the default roster, but never gated:
                  resolvable by id, searchable in the bay's SPECIALIST ARCHIVE, and summonable as-is.
                  Their real job is seeding the scout's personalized minting — when the station's
                  LEARNED interests point at one, the scout stages it as a DRAFTED-FOR-YOU prospect
                  (sidecar/scout.js matchArchetype), so the long tail arrives exactly when it's relevant.

   LOADOUT fields (Class Loadouts) added to every specialty:
     kit:    [objectType,...]   real CAP_REGISTRY object types = the SHARED STATION GEAR this class draws on under
                                the overseer (informational — shown in the dossier with a live present/missing
                                check, and used to gate the class's skill availability). NOT per-agent props: the
                                only object an agent owns is its own desk; capabilities are station-level shared
                                gear used under the overseer (Andrew's rule, 2026-07-02). Never a flag, never issued.

                                over the global prefs); each slug's `requires` must be a SUBSET of `kit` (the class

                                advisory model-tier pip stays cosmetic.

   The model tier ('reasoning'|'balanced'|'fast') stays an INDIRECTION — it resolves to a concrete model
   at summon through the user's configured model, never a hardcoded id in the catalog.

     Same laws as BUILTINS (kit-grounded, tool-honest, prompt-tight). The bay lists them only in the
     SPECIALIST ARCHIVE (search / expand — never gated); the scout's matchArchetype stages one as a
     DRAFTED-FOR-YOU prospect when the station's learned interests actually point at it.
     2026-07-16 redesign: chief/operator/scribe/designer/tutor/navigator/curator/muse were demoted here
     from the old roster (generalist/lifestyle jobs — real, just not majority-business). liaison,
     publicist, and bookkeeper were RETIRED outright: envoy, marketer+publisher, and treasurer are
     their strict supersets, and a near-duplicate archetype would shadow the real class in the scout's
     matcher. 2026-07-17: envoy itself demoted off the roster (Andrew's call) — it lives here now.
     2026-08-03 expansion: chief, envoy, and tutor were PROMOTED back onto the roster (their demand was
     never niche — the demotion was a business-bar artefact). scribe was RETIRED outright: with writer
     (scripts/hooks) and the new ghostwriter (writes in the Commander's own voice) on the roster, a
     general "writing & editing" class is a strict subset of both and would shadow them in the scout's
     matcher. curator and muse were KEPT: file-tidying and ideation are genuinely distinct jobs from
     archivist (recall) and strategist (direction), so retiring them would have deleted real coverage.
     Two new deep cuts arrived here rather than on the roster — quartermaster (household paper trail)
